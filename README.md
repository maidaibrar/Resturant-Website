# 🍽️ Restaurant Website

As my first step into the world of web development, I created a restaurant website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to design a visually appealing and responsive platform that showcases food items, categories, and smooth user interactions. This project sparked my passion for building functional yet aesthetic web experiences.
